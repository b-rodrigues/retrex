The goal of `{wontrun}` is to test the longevity of old code for the R programming language by making
it easy to run examples from archived package sources on current versions of packages.

## Installation

`{wontrun}` is not available on CRAN, but you can install the development version like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("b-rodrigues/wontrun", ref = "master")
```

## Example

Get the archived sources for the `{dplyr}` package:

```{r}
library(wontrun)
dplyr_sources <- get_archived_sources("dplyr")
```

This is what this looks like:

```{r}
dplyr_sources
```

Let's also choose how many cores we want to use to run the examples, as this is a 
time-consuming operation:

```{r, eval = F}
cl <- 6
```

We can now run the examples contained in the archived packages with the `wontrun()` function:

```{r, eval = F}
# By default, wontrun() will only consider the earliest package in a given year
dplyr_runs <- wontrun(head(dplyr_sources, 1),
                      ncpus = cl,
                      setup = TRUE,
                      wontrun_lib = "~/six_to/wontrun_lib/")
```

Using `setup = TRUE` and a path for `wontrun_lib` creates a fresh new library that can be used 
for the sole purpose of running these examples. 

The result looks like this:

```{r, echo = F} 
dplyr_runs <- readRDS("dplyr_runs.Rds")
```

The package provides a `decode_wontrun()` function to summarise the results:

```{r}
decode_wontrun(dplyr_runs)
```
